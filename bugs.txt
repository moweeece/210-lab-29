Bug #1: Task always set to "picking" during random task selection
    Eliminated an inner for loop.

Bug #2: Program crashed when opening an empty file.
    Corrected by adding a data validation check if the file is empty or not

Bug #3: Vector and Map was not passing to functions correctly.
    Corrected argument syntax to properly pass the arguments

Bug #4: Robot IDs were not outputting sequentially
    Eliminated an inner for loop and made sure that tasks were correctly being assigned

Bug #5: Output did not have clarity as to time intervals
    Corrected output syntax and logic to provide a more clear visual of time intervals and the status of each robot

Bug #6: Robots did not perform tasks after each simulation ended
    Corrected nested for loop logic 

Bug #7: RobotID and task variables were not declared in scope of simulateRobotTasks function
    Corrected by moving the switch logic and assignments into the nested for loop

Bug #8: Robot Task are not printed if task list is empty
    Added a check if the task was empty and assigned charging as a default

Bug #9: Robot would print Robot x is recharging: y
    Corrected if and else if arguments from "charging" to "recharging"

    Corrected file naming typos and differentiated "fin" to be finFileOne and finFileTwo to help troubleshoot
